Due to having three groups in this program, you can work with different categories of users


User names in Excel file are based on the name saved in your WhatsApp


You can choose different submission methods, for example send a text to users or send a file with text to all users or send a separate file for each user but the same text


This program can supports many formats 

This program supports most video, photo and file formats

But for audio, it only supports mp3 format

You must enter the address of the file or folder in the address field of the program

The first column is the name of the files, which is named after the number, but in the next version, the ability to send based on the name is added


The second column is the user's saved name in your WhatsApp

For example, a file named 1 is sent to Sepehr
Of course, this happens in mode Based on numbering


When you use the "Send a file to everyone" mode, numbering is no longer important, you just have to give the address of the file
